# Habitable Planets Finder

This is a Node.js project that reads data from a CSV file containing information about planets discovered by the Kepler telescope, filters the data to identify potentially habitable planets, and outputs the names of those planets.

## Dependencies

- `csv-parse`: A library for parsing CSV data in Node.js.
- `fs`: A built-in Node.js module for working with the file system.

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command in the terminal:
npm install


## Usage

To run the script and output the names of the habitable planets, run the following command:

node index.js


The script will read the data from the `kepler_data.csv` file in the root directory of the project, filter the data to identify potentially habitable planets, and output the names of those planets to the console.
